# Introduction

Before this lab, our knowledge of exploratory and manual functional testing was primarily theoretical. We had studied these testing methodologies in coursework and read about them in various software engineering resources. However, we had not yet gained hands-on experience in applying them to a real-world system.  

This lab provided an opportunity to interact with an **ATM simulation system**, where we could actively explore its functionalities and document defects. The experience helped us bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by directly identifying and tracking software issues.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our exploratory testing approach involved the following steps:

1. **Understanding the System**  
   We started by familiarizing ourselves with the ATM simulation software. This involved reading the requirements document, understanding the expected behavior, and identifying key functionalities such as login, withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.

2. **Defining Testing Objectives**  
   We targeted critical functionalities that users commonly interact with. This included ensuring that transactions were processed correctly, checking for system crashes, and verifying error handling.

3. **Executing Tests Dynamically**  
   Unlike scripted testing, we did not follow predefined test cases. Instead, we interacted with the system freely, trying out different combinations of inputs to identify potential defects. We paid special attention to edge cases, such as entering invalid card numbers or exceeding balance limits.

4. **Recording Defects**  
   Every defect we encountered was documented systematically. We noted down the function being tested, initial system state, steps to reproduce the defect, expected vs. actual results, and assigned a severity level.

This approach allowed us to uncover defects that structured manual scripted testing might not have identified. By exploring the system without predefined constraints, we observed unexpected behaviors and system inconsistencies.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory and manual functional testing serve different purposes and have distinct advantages and trade-offs.

- **Approach and Flexibility**  
  Exploratory testing is unscripted and more flexible. Testers dynamically interact with the system to find defects. Manual functional testing, on the other hand, follows predefined test cases, ensuring structured and repeatable testing.

- **Efficiency and Effectiveness**  
  Exploratory testing is highly effective in uncovering new and unexpected defects, as testers can quickly adapt and explore different areas of the software. Manual functional testing, however, is more systematic and ensures that all specified test cases are executed correctly.

- **Documentation and Reproducibility**  
  Since exploratory testing is informal, it requires careful documentation of steps taken to reproduce defects. Manual functional testing, being structured, automatically provides a record of test cases and results, making it easier to track testing coverage.

- **Trade-offs**  
  Exploratory testing can be more time-efficient for identifying unknown defects, but it does not guarantee comprehensive test coverage. Manual functional testing ensures all planned scenarios are tested but might miss unexpected issues.

Both testing approaches complement each other. Exploratory testing helps discover unknown defects, while manual functional testing verifies known functionalities systematically.


# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

As part of the assignment, we conducted peer reviews of defect reports created by different team members. Each member cross-checked reports for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.  

During the review process, we focused on the following aspects:
- Ensuring the defect descriptions were clear and detailed enough for reproduction.
- Verifying that expected and actual outcomes were correctly stated.
- Checking the severity levels assigned to defects to ensure they were reasonable.
- Ensuring that no critical details were missing, such as system version and defect status.

Through peer reviews, we improved the quality of our defect reports, refined the documentation process, and gained insights into different perspectives on software issues.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

To maximize efficiency, we divided responsibilities among group members using a **pair testing approach**. Each pair consisted of a **tester** and a **reviewer**.

- **Tester Role:**  
  One member actively interacted with the system, performed test cases, and identified potential defects.

- **Reviewer Role:**  
  The other member observed the testing process, took notes, and helped refine defect reports.

After initial testing, roles were **swapped** so that each team member could experience both perspectives. Once both pairs had completed their tests, we consolidated defect reports and reviewed them collectively.

Collaboration and communication were key to ensuring effective testing coverage and defect tracking.


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

### **Difficulties Encountered**  
1. **Understanding the SUT Behavior**  
   Initially, understanding the ATM simulation system’s behavior was challenging. Some UI elements were not intuitive, making certain functions difficult to navigate.

2. **Documenting Defects Precisely**  
   Describing defects clearly while ensuring that all reproduction steps were recorded took time and effort.

3. **Distinguishing Between System Bugs and Intended Features**  
   Some behaviors seemed like bugs at first, but upon checking the requirements, we realized they were intentional system responses.

### **Challenges Overcome**  
- We overcame the system navigation issue by reading the documentation thoroughly and collaborating to understand expected behaviors.
- Defect documentation improved over time as we refined our reporting format and ensured consistency across reports.
- We cross-checked system requirements before reporting defects to avoid misidentifying expected behaviors as bugs.

### **Lessons Learned**  
- **Exploratory testing is powerful** for identifying unexpected issues but requires careful documentation.
- **Manual functional testing is crucial** for validating known functionalities systematically.
- **Effective communication and peer reviews enhance the quality** of defect reporting.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

### **Positive Aspects**  
- The lab provided **valuable hands-on experience** in software testing methodologies.  
- Using **an actual defect tracking system** helped us understand industry-standard practices.  
- The **ATM simulation system was a good choice** as it had various functionalities that required thorough testing.  

### **Areas for Improvement**  
- The **instructions for setting up and running the ATM simulation** could be clearer. Initially, we struggled to start the system and understand its limitations.  
- **Regression testing steps could be expanded** with more structured guidelines to help differentiate between fixed and unresolved defects.  

Overall, this lab was a useful exercise in understanding software testing methodologies, defect tracking, and the importance of documentation in real-world software development.
